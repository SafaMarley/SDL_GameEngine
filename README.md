# SDL_GameEngine
# A walking simulation I developed with the basic game engine architecture I built using the SDL library. I might or might not add more components, and/or improve the structure in the future but I am not working on it for now.

In this project, I got familiar with the game initialization and loop implementation, Unity like entity-component system architecture, a camera system, a map-building method in 2D games, and a basic collision detection approach.
